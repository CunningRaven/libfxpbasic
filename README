libfxpbasic: Implement a basic 32.32 fixed point toolkit using C and assembly on ARM architecture.  It will make items as follow:
1. libfxpbasic.so: main objective providing basic calculations of 32.32 fixed-point decimals. They're:
    fxpneg: to let a 32.32 fixed-point decimal become its opposite;
    fxpadd: addition of two;
    fxpsub: subtraction;
    fxpmul_unsigned: multiplication of two unsigned;
    fxpmul_signed: multiplication of two signed;
    fxpdiv_unsigned: division of two unsigned;
    fxpdiv_signed: division of two signed;
    fxp_pi : a constant which is the 32.32 fixed-point decimal most closed to ratio of circumference to diameter.
    fxp_e : a constant which is the 32.32 fixed-point decimal most closed to natural constant.
    fxpsin: sine fxp.
    fxpcos: cosine of fxp.
    fxptan: tangent of fxp.
    fxpexp: returns the value of e raised to the power of its argument.
    fxpln: returns the natural logarithm of its argument.
2. test_fxpbasic: a simple calculator to test our shared object.

To generate the lib:
    make
To generate the calculator for testing:
    make calculator.debug
